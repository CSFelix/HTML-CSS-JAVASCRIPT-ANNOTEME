### `❓ What's it? ❓`

* AnnoteMe is a website where you can list your everyday tasks. The tasks are storaged in your browser's cache, that is:

```
- there are no database;
- if you clear up the cbrowser's cache, all tasks will be miss;
- the tasks available in one browser won't be in another (each browser has your own cache)
```
* I will storage the tasks in a database later, in MySQL or MongoDB (probably will be this last), and create a sign up and sign in page!!

----
### `⚒️ Tools ⚒️`

* HTML, CSS, JavaScript;
* Font-Awesome and Fonts-Google API;
* Any Browser (tested succesfully in Opera, Opera GX, Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge and Firefox).

----
### `⚙️ Run ⚙️`

* Download the source code;
* Open **index.html** folder in your browser;
* Annote your tasks!!

----
### `🎁 Bonus 🎁`

* Private Mode: all tasks added in browser's private mode will be deleted when you close the software (private mode doesn't save cache).
